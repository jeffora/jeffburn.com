Kacela reached down and with a grunt of exertion yanked the spear free, earning a spurt of blood to the face for the effort. With the spear removed, the wound on the wolf’s back began to heal before Vallamere’s eyes, as did the gash on Kacela’s forearm.

Vallamere admired his companion as she wiped blood and sweat from her face. Her pale golden complexion, although hidden under a heavy layer of road dust, was at odds to the clammy rotting grey of what little skin Vallamere had left. Her normally slender and seductive figure was hidden beneath her imposing battle armour. The suit, an eerily beautiful yet terrifying conglomerate of blue steel plating, scale mail and magically hardened bone, made quite a daunting figure of the normally petite girl.

Meeting her eyes, Vallamere resisted the urge to flinch. Her usually light and happy demeanour had been replaced with a façade of cold fury. Her pale green eyes that so often danced with mischievous laughter now held only tightly bridled wrath in their sapphire depths.

They formed a mismatched pair, Vallamere thought. Everything about Kacela was neat, flawless and exuded calm, whereas Vallamere was the personification of chaos.

He bore the telltale signs of the plague. His skin had almost completely decayed over the twenty years, exposing the bone underneath, and what little remained hung in tatters from his skeletal frame. His organs and muscles had rotted away in the early years of his affliction. The plague had taken everything any human required to live yet, as was the case with so many of those infected, it seemed to fall short of taking life itself. So here he stood, a mess of chipped and worn bones and tattered, rotting skin, dead… yet not.

Vallamere snapped out of his reverie and turned his attention to the task at hand. The savannah stretched out below them. Knee-high grass blanketed the plane, swaying melodically in the gentle wind. Herds grazed placidly in the distance. The afternoon sun cast a golden light over the grasslands, enhancing the majestic beauty of the land. Everything was peaceful. But Vallamere cared not for the beauty, and peace was far from what he had in mind.
