Bitter wind whipped at John's coat as he walked briskly along the bank of the Thames. Big Ben, his destination, loomed ahead, drawing inexorably closer. The grey sky was darkening rapidly as the sun gave up its failed attempts at warming the city, and retired for the night. However, neither weather nor the onset of night penetrated John's thoughts. His mind was somewhere else as he ploughed into the well-dressed business man hurrying in the other direction. "Terribly sorry," John hastily muttered. The man was already continuing on his way. John noticed a small box on the ground; it must have fallen from the man's pocket. He quickly stooped to retrieve it, then chased after him. "Excuse me sir, I believe this is yours!"

As John arrived, the man saw the box in his outstretched hand. He quickly patted the pockets of his coat before taking the offered box. He looked highly relieved as he said "Thank you so much! This is not something I fancy losing."

"Happy New Year to you sir," John said, before turning and continuing on his way.

"Bonsoir monsieur et mademoiselle, I will be your garçon for zis evening. Have you any requirements do not 'esitate to ask." Oliver smiled at the warm welcome from their French host, and wondered how much of the accent was put on for the benefit of the 'Eenglish' patrons. Stacey shared his smile as he took her by the hand and led her through the entrance hall into the opulent dining room of Gordon Ramsay, one of London's premiere French restaurants.

The warmth of the room was a welcome contrast to the bitter winter night outside. Soft yellow light bathed all in its radiant glow, with the occasional sparkle from the magnificent chandelier dancing along mahogany wall or table-top. The garçon was waiting beside their table – candlelit within its own alcove.

"Oh Oli! It's beautiful." Stacey leaned up to kiss him before accepting the proffered seat. Turning to his own seat, Oliver nervously ran a hand over his waist-coat pocket, confirming for the hundredth time that the ring still presided within.

Oliver took his seat opposite Stacey. This New Year's Eve marked two years since they had first met. She had only been nineteen, and had just completed her first year of study. He was celebrating the end of his Laws degree. In a typical display of male celebratory arrogance, he wagered twenty pounds with his best friend that after the countdown, she would be going home with him. He had lost the bet, receiving instead only a midnight kiss and a phone number. Despite the ridicule of his friends, that night's result had turned out to be infinitely better than the quick shag he had sought.

Robert stared out of the hospital window. It was a clear day in New York, and deceptively warm indoors. The air outside, he knew, would be crisp and chilly. 

Robert left the window and returned to his wife's side. "How are you feeling?" he asked. He tried to keep his voice light, but was unable to disguise the trace of unease he felt.

"I'm fine Robert. And don't worry. Induced labour is normal for a woman of my age – I'm not young and perfect anymore. It's just to ensure that the birth goes smoothly and our little baby enters this world without any problems."

Robert smiled, but could not completely dispel his worry. They had come in today, on New Year's Eve, for a routine check-up two weeks before the baby was due. However, the doctor had informed them that their child had a higher than normal heart rate. Not cause for undue concern, he assured them, but he would be inducing labour to ensure the safety of the baby. That was an hour ago. Now they were waiting in the hospital room for the doctor to return.

John slowly withdrew his phone from his pocket as the SMS tone sounded. A single word glared out from the screen: 'Ready'. His heart began to race as he fiddled around within his phone's menu. Finding the right option, he waited a moment as a numeric display appeared on the screen. Satisfied, John closed the phone and returned it to his pocket, before hurrying on his way.

"Stace, would you marry me?" Stacey choked in surprise at the suddenness of the question. Oliver grinned at her over their meals. "I mean, you know, if I was to ask?"  

"If you were to ask?" she repeated, still taken aback by surprise, although the corners of her own mouth began to upturn in response to Oliver's grin.

"If I was to get down on one knee," Oliver continued, sinking to a kneel in front of her and removing the ring from his waist-coat pocket. "And offer you a ring and ask 'Stacey, will you marry me?'..." He left the question hanging as he stared up at her.

Sarah had been in induced labour for three hours now, and her contractions were beginning to come more regularly. Her most recent one had just passed when Robert's phone began vibrating along the bedside table. Startled by the harsh noise, Robert reached down to see who was calling. He smiled to see his daughter's photo beaming up at him from the phone's screen. "Stacey!" he exclaimed happily. "How are you?" and without waiting for a reply, "I've been trying to reach you for hours now, but couldn't seem to get through. I have some great news for you!"

"Hi dad!" Stacey replied excitedly when Robert paused to draw breath. "I've got some exciting news of my own! But what's yours first? Is it mum? Do I have a little brother or sister?"

"Not yet," Robert laughed, "But it won't be long. The doctor has induced labour, and our little baby will be born in the next few hours!"

"Oh dad, that's fantastic. But induced labour? Is everything alright?"

"Everything's fine. It's just a precaution, and apparently quite a normal procedure for older women. Anyway, I'll put mum on, she's right here. Oh, but before I do, what's your news that's got you calling from London?"

Robert was ecstatic to hear Stacey's news. An engagement and a new baby all in one day.

John checked his watch again. Only two minutes had passed since the last time he had looked. Frustrated and impatient, he left the river-front and moved deeper into the crowd. He emerged onto the other, slightly less crowded side of the street, and found himself a lamp-post to lean against. A couple sat nearby, leaning against the wall of one of the street-side buildings. They sat close, sharing warmth and holding hands. The man shifted and John realised, with a jolt, that it was the same gentleman he had run into earlier today. The lady lifted a hand to brush away a stray hair from her face, and her finger sparkled in the light from the street-lamp. John remembered the small box that had fallen from the man's pocket. His chest tightened, and he suddenly felt sick, and desired nothing other than to leave.

As if on cue, a voice resounded over the speakers, announcing "Only fifteen minutes to midnight!"

John's breath quickened as the crowd cheered, and his nausea deepened as all around him happy smiling faces slowly shuffled toward the river-front. That's it, he thought to himself, no more. He left his lamp-post and all but ran along the footpath, trying to put as much distance between himself and the sickeningly happy New Year's celebrations as he could.

* * * *

Robert paced the small room. It had been fifteen minutes since the nurse had guided him out of his wife's delivery room. His unease at the induced labour had come to a head when the doctor had announced that they would need to conduct a forceps delivery. They had removed him from the room so that his panic didn't cause his wife any distress through the procedure, but this waiting was wreaking havoc on his nerves.

Robert stopped pacing as the TV in the corner of the room caught his attention. An afternoon news bulletin was covering New Year's celebrations in other parts of the world. "And now we go live to London," the presenter was saying, "where outside Big Ben thousands of people have gathered to welcome in the New Year, which is just minutes away."

The timely distraction had an immediate calming effect on Robert, and he sat down to watch.

* * * *

Oliver pulled Stacey to her feet, and they joined the multitudes pressing towards the river-front. He wrapped his arms around her and drew her closer to him as they waited. The top song of the year was playing through the speakers, and Stacey swayed gently with the music, humming along. As the final notes of the song faded, the announcer once again came to the microphone. "Ladies and Gentlemen, the moment we are all waiting for is approaching! The Final Countdown for 2007! Are you ready? Ten!"

The crowd immediately picked up the chant, shouting away the last seconds of the year.

Locked in Oliver's gaze, Stacey echoed, "Seven...Six...Five..."

* * * *

John pounded along the pavement, but his footsteps were not loud enough to drown out the noises around him. Familiar explosions filled the air and the dull echo of cheering floated along in his wake. Nearer at hand, those friends and families who preferred a less crowded riverbank exchanged jovially shouted well-wishes with one another. And in his mind he could see them all, thousands of awestruck faces, gazing heavenward, illuminated by the radiance of the fireworks, then fading into darkness only to reappear tinted blue or green or purple.

John sagged against the riverbank wall, raggedly trying to catch his breath. He drew his phone from his pocket. He would have his own countdown, he thought to himself, as he watched the numbers flicker on the screen. The phone was eerily silent as it ticked away the final seconds. "Four...Three...Two," John softly whispered to himself. The timer stopped, and a gaudy 'Happy New Year' bathed the screen. The bitter irony of it stung him, and screaming, John stood and threw his phone with all his might into the river.

"...One!" The camera zoomed out as fireworks lit up the television screen. Through the speakers, the tinny soundtrack to London's lightshow could be heard over the excited roar of the crowd. Robert smiled to himself as he watched the Thames River come alive under the reflected light of a thousand fireworks.

The music climbed to an inevitable climax, and the show grew in intensity, completing with a spectacular finale which lit up the night. The voice-over returned to the speakers as the final sparks and gunpowder-smoke descended on the river. "Well there you have it folks. What a magnificent way to welcome in 2008 with a-"

The riverbank exploded. The dark night was flooded with harsh orange and yellow light, engaging the Thames in a lightshow once again; a lightshow spawned in hell.

Robert's heart stopped. He couldn't breathe. What was going on? For ages he sat there, dumbfounded, as static screamed out of the TV speakers. He wasn't aware as the door opened behind him, and a nurse entered. It was only after she called his name three times that he managed to pull himself together, to turn and acknowledge her.

"Congratulations, Robert. You have a baby daughter."
