I take his hand in mine. Gently, of course, I don't want to scare the poor wretch. His other hand trembles slightly, where it rests in his mother's grip. Ah, but of course the tremble belongs to her, born of lingering fear and rising pain. No, the child is calm now, relaxed. He stands ready, between his grieving mother and this grim old man. I speak figuratively, of course. The boy is lying, as those in a hospital bed are wont to do. Seldom do my clients stand to greet me.

I draw him away, leaving the mother to her growing sobs. We pass the foot of the bed and his hospital chart. In bold along the top, 'Prediction: Leukaemia'. Scrawled underneath, 'Not for resuscitation'. Come along child, this is not your place anymore. No, don't look back, you don't want to see. Trust me.

But let us move along. I am not here to tell you of dying babes and grieving mothers. Even for me, it is never a pleasant story. No, today I have a truly rare tale, of love and naïveté, of loss and mercy. Of happiness... and an old man's folly. It begins, with a man named...

* * * * 

Carl smiled at Jacqui, kissing her forehead as she snuggled in next to him. In his hand, he held a small photo. It was black and white, blurry, and nearly unintelligible. It was perfect. Jacqui reached out and traced her finger over the photo. "She's going to be beautiful."

"She?" Carl asked, laughing, as he rested his hand on his wife's swollen belly. "I thought we decided not to find out."

"Woman's intuition," Jacqui responded sleepily, as she began to drift away on his shoulder.

Carl smiled, looking back to the photo. "Beautiful, I agree. But I think you've got a little grey fuzzy boy growing inside of you." The groggy murmured response sounded something like "not fuzzy". Carl chuckled as he put his arm around her and turned on the TV for the evening news.

"... and in other news tonight," the anchor spoke, as the picture faded in, "research scientists believe they have found a way to predict exactly how you are going to die."

Must be a slow news day, Carl thought, as they cut to a lab coated scientist explaining the research. Even if this wasn't a silly hoax to fill a news slot, "Why would anyone possibly want to know how they were going to die?" he mused aloud. His wife made no reply other than to snuggle into him contentedly.

* * * *

It is, I believe, the product of your most aptly named morbid curiosity. The predictions have always existed, you see. Your scientist simply found a way to reveal them. It was his most regrettable achievement, for I will say this of your machine: I have never seen a mother weep less for a child gone given the knowledge he was leaving. Death is always hardest for the living. When I take your hand in mine at the end, your prediction counts for nothing; it can control only the way you live.

Imagine a young married couple, pregnant with their first child. Imagine how their lives would change if the young lady knew she was to die in childbirth. Imagine that, if you will. I doubt it should be too hard.

Carl paced nervously. Complications, he had been told, before his wife was spirited away for emergency surgery. That was over an hour ago, and he had heard nothing. The adrenaline of the frantic drive to the hospital, as Jacqui entered labour, had departed, leaving a sickly nausea in its place. The happiness and excitement were now buried deep within, cowering under guard of ruthless fear.

At the click of the door Carl stopped, turned. The doctor entered the room, flanked by shadows of dread and despair. Carl gasped, the shadows catching in his throat as he sank to his knees. His fear erupted inside, happiness and excitement executed in one brutal moment. 'Too late' were the only words he heard.

* * * *

I looked into her eyes as she lay there, and she into mine. I watched understanding awaken within, and relief that the pain was gone. I nursed the babe in my own arms, as I led the mother from the room. But that day, I broke my own rule. They led him in as we moved away, and just before we departed, we looked back. I would spare you the details of that cold scene, but suffice it to say that even my tired, dead heart is not immune to cracking. The cries of the wife that accompanied me were as nothing to the howls that chased.

* * * *

"He's going to take the test," Ellie murmured into the phone. Carl had just left, carefully gathering up the pieces of his broken heart, before slowly making his way down the apartment stairs. It was the same every week. Ellie would play host to the shadow of her once exuberant and charismatic best friend. Carl would leave the worst of his grief on the mantel by the door, out of sight but not completely out of mind. For the next hour or two, over a cup of tea or three, they would sit and talk of nothing. Then Carl would leave, and Ellie would call Liz, climbing the telephone line back out of the hole of Carl's depression. They were not happy evenings, but for Carl at least it allowed the pain to recede, for just a moment.

"I said I'd go with him," Ellie continued somberly. A gentle query floated down the line towards her. The climb was not going well tonight, not with the prospect of another descent in the morning. "I know," she sighed in reply. "I just can't bear to see him go through with it alone. I... I think he's going to try and seek it out."

A brief attentive pause, listening, followed by a longer reflective silence. "No," Ellie said finally, "Not suicidal. But if it says 'Crushed by Piano' he'll probably start camping outside a music store."

* * * *

As I have said, the predictions have always existed. Only the execution, if you will excuse the pun, belongs to me. But with that measure of control there exists a chance. A chance for compassion. A chance, if not to right old wrongs, at least to ease old pains. A chance, I had hoped, to show mercy.

* * * *

Silence entered the small room, riding the words of a small slip of paper. She was expected; Carl would read the words as silence held him close. She would comfort and shield him as he devoured their meaning. And then she would respectfully depart, and he would cry or laugh or yell or deny or simply sigh and nod. The doctor had seen it a hundred times before; every prediction followed the pattern. But today she didn't leave. Silence lingered on, becoming the awkward guest in the room. Carl had not moved; he sat expressionless, staring at the slip of paper.

The doctor cleared his throat. Silence was an uncomfortable presence now and he intended to ask her to leave. "That's quite a unique prediction," he began. "And quite a pleasant one, as far as they go..."

Silence glared. He obliged. Oblivious to the exchange, Carl stood to leave. As he raised his head, the doctor caught a glimpse into his eyes. Silence lingered for a long while after his departure, reproachful.

They sat at the water's edge, quiet. Ellie had followed Carl from the doctor's office. Although he didn't seem to object to her company, he was yet to say anything. And Ellie knew not to ask. Death predictions were rattling no matter what your state, and Carl was a long way south of fragile.

Drowning, perhaps, she had thought as they'd headed towards the lake. Was she about to witness an attempt at suicide? Would she try to stop it? Her own fear had risen, and she was no closer to any decision when they'd arrived. But then Carl had just stopped, sat. So she sat with him, and waited.

"I'm going to have a long life."

Ellie glanced across at him. Carl stared out over the water, hunched under the weight of the words as they hung around his neck. Without looking her way, he stretched out his hand, passing her a folded slip of paper. She was confused by his words, and more than a little chilled by his tone, as she unfolded the prediction.

Happiness. For a moment, nothing. Then, as when waking at night to find the darkness is reality, realisation. Happiness. Oh.

Carl was looking at her now. A small smile flickered briefly over his face, sad and hopeless, and never reaching his eyes. Ellie looked away, unable to hold his gaze. This slip of paper was the only happiness in Carl's life. There certainly wasn't any in his smile.

* * * *

It was hope that I envisaged, you see. A glimmer of the faintest light in the darkness that now made up that life. What is more cruel, I had asked myself. To strike down a man in the height of his happiness, leaving a pregnant wife alone and afraid. A wife, who in her turn I would collect in the midst of pain and grief, robbed of the chance to move on from sorrow. Or the alternative, to take away a happy wife and unborn babe, swiftly after only a moment of fear. To leave behind a man broken with despair, perhaps for years, but who faces a change in fates, a return to happiness before the end.

So I asked myself that question, and thought I knew the answer. To this day, I continue to ask myself that question...

* * * *

Functionality slowly returned to Carl's life over the years. The pain never completely departed, but the wounds slowly healed, first to scabs, then ugly tender scars. He no longer left his grief on Ellie's mantel, but played uncle to her children instead. He smiled and even laughed, but never for long, and always off key. He held down jobs, and never thought of death. In a world that grew ever more obsessed with it, for him it remained elusive. Carl was still a broken man.

* * * *

Time heals all wounds, as they say. So I had thought it would be, and so it was. But in my naïveté I never considered that the healing of wounds would not be enough. So, my old friend. Forgive me. What I considered a mercy, a hope, has turned into a life sentence, and I never meant it so. But as I sit here now, and look in your eyes the colour of grief, I ask of you but once more. Hold on...

* * * *

Carl was an old man now, tired and sad. But for a small slip of paper, his life was empty. So day by day, he came to the park and sat, listened to the wind for the voices of friends long gone, and never thought of death.

* * * *

... for it will come.
