"You're late," Vallamere rasped, the statement grating over the worn bone where his lip used to be. It was nigh on twenty years since the plague had taken his human life and body and left him with this cursed existence, yet he still regretted the loss of such basic human abilities, like normal, intelligible speech. And spitting, he thought, as a fly flew through his shattered left cheek-bone, circled around his mouth, then departed through his right nostril.

"I was held up," the newcomer muttered. Vallamere glanced to his right to notice his companion in full battle armour, rather than her usual leather hunting garb. As she reached up and removed her helm, Vallamere saw a vicious gash along the fleshy underside of her forearm.

"Kacela, you're..."

"Fine!" she cut in, before he could fret about the wound.

At the sound of a guttural growl, Kacela turned to her right and Vallamere noticed the presence of her faithful wolf for the first time.

The signs of a recent battle were abundantly clear from the state of the beast. There was the panting, limping and blood-soaked muzzle, but the real give-away was the trophy of battle borne, quite literally, by the beast. Somewhere in the course of the previous engagement, a short throwing spear had become lodged between the wolf's shoulder blades.

Kacela reached down and with a grunt of exertion yanked the spear free, earning a spurt of blood to the face for the effort. With the spear removed, the wound on the wolf's back began to heal before Vallamere's eyes, as did the gash on Kacela's forearm.

Vallamere admired his companion as she wiped blood and sweat from her face. Her pale golden complexion, although hidden under a heavy layer of road dust, was at odds to the clammy rotting grey of what little skin Vallamere had left. Her normally slender and seductive figure was hidden beneath her imposing battle armour. The suit, an eerily beautiful yet terrifying conglomerate of blue steel plating, scale mail and magically hardened bone, made quite a daunting figure of the normally petite girl.

Meeting her eyes, Vallamere resisted the urge to flinch. Her usually light and happy demeanour had been replaced with a façade of cold fury. Her pale green eyes that so often danced with mischievous laughter now held only tightly bridled wrath in their sapphire depths.

They formed a mismatched pair, Vallamere thought. Everything about Kacela was neat, flawless and exuded calm, whereas Vallamere was the personification of chaos.

He bore the telltale signs of the plague. His skin had almost completely decayed over the twenty years, exposing the bone underneath, and what little remained hung in tatters from his skeletal frame. His organs and muscles had rotted away in the early years of his affliction. The plague had taken everything any human required to live yet, as was the case with so many of those infected, it seemed to fall short of taking life itself. So here he stood, a mess of chipped and worn bones and tattered, rotting skin, dead... yet not.

Vallamere snapped out of his reverie and turned his attention to the task at hand. The savannah stretched out below them. Knee-high grass blanketed the plane, swaying melodically in the gentle wind. Herds grazed placidly in the distance. The afternoon sun cast a golden light over the grasslands, enhancing the majestic beauty of the land. Everything was peaceful. But Vallamere cared not for the beauty, and peace was far from what he had in mind.

Vallamere looked directly down from the rocky outcrop upon which he and Kacela were perched. Nestled within the defensive embrace of this geological anomaly was a camp of humans. The disciplined order and defensible layout of the camp marked it as military, and the crest borne on the flag outside the general's tent confirmed that this was the group Vallamere had been tracking for nearly two year.

"It won't bring him back."

Vallamere didn't shift his gaze as Kacela spoke. General Kel and his band of mercenaries, aptly named The Plague, were the fiercest fighters in these lands. Their prowess in battle was only surpassed by their cruelty. This cruelty was well known to Vallamere. Two years ago he had received a message from General Kel himself. The message came in the form of a skull; the skull of Vallamere's brother.

"What will this achieve Vallamere?" Kacela continued. "We will probably both end up..."

The tone of her voice caused him to look up as she stopped mid sentence. Following her gaze, Vallamere noticed what had caught her attention. Entering the camp were two riders leading four saddled but riderless horses. Vallamere looked back at Kacela, and would have raised an eyebrow had that function still been available to him.

"I'm impressed," he grated.

Her eyes hardened at the sight of her assailants, her fury reignited. Vallamere began to check his armour. Demonic black steel encased his body. The suit was a weapon in itself, with giant wing-like blades affixed to the shoulder pads. Enchanted hellfire encased the gloves, burning any unfortunate enough to come in contact with it, but leaving the wearer unharmed. Two blades hung in scabbards at his waist. They were a pair – midnight tempered steel like the armour, slightly curved and viciously barbed along the lower portion of the blade. He also had a two-handed great-sword strapped to his back. This blade was taller than Vallamere himself.

"Are you ready?" Vallamere asked as he unlooped the skull he had carried with him for two years from his belt.

"How many mercenaries did you say are in this camp?"

The evil leer that was permanently expressed on Vallamere's face was, for once, appropriate as he answered, "Not nearly enough!" His voice was as wind through a graveyard, and every bit as ominous.

They had been able to remain hidden from view from their rocky vantage point, but now Vallamere stepped into plain sight and threw the skull over the edge. By the time it landed at the entrance of the General's tent, Vallamere and Kacela were gone from the ledge and descending on the camp.

Kacela stopped on a small rise some distance from the camp entrance and unlimbered her bow. Five of the mercenaries were approaching from the camp. Clearly, they did not see the two as a threat. That would soon change. Vallamere unsheathed his swords and began to walk slowly and steadily towards the approaching soldiers.

Kacela nocked an arrow and drew back the bowstring, preparing to fire. She muttered a few words and the arrow began to glow silver and crackle with electric tension.

The soldiers had broken into a run now. With a distance of no more than ten yards separating them, Vallamere charged.

A bladed shoulder crashed into the face of the first soldier. Blood sprayed as his face collapsed inwards. Training kicking in, the mercenary to the left made to strike at Vallamere's exposed back. However, before he could swing his blade, Kacela's arcane missile exploded into his shoulder, ripping his arm clean from his body and sending him flying back several metres.

As his momentum carried him forward, Vallamere raked his right blade down across the chest of the nearest soldier. The barbs on the blade caught in the links of her mail, shattering them and pulling her in so that the upper curve of the blade sliced deeply into exposed flesh.

The two remaining mercenaries jumped back, stunned by the viciousness of the attack. Vallamere pressed his advantage, leaping at the nearest with his right blade raised high. The mercenary raised his own blade to parry the blow, leaving himself completely exposed as Vallamere's left blade slid up and under his rib cage to spear the heart.

Vallamere released his grip on the blade and turned, crouching, ready to counterattack the final mercenary. However, the precaution was unnecessary as he simply stumbled and fell, an arrow protruding from his eye socket.

Several mercenaries were streaming from the camp now as Vallamere wrenched his blade free from his victim's chest. He let out a piercing cry and the battle was joined. He struck like lightning and the first two mercenaries were down, one trying to hold in the contents of his abdomen and the other suffering an arterial bleed from the leg.

As the first two fell, more took their place and very soon he was surrounded, blades whirring to parry attacks.

A vicious riposte opened another's jugular just as Vallamere was shoved back. A blade rammed up and under his chest-piece, through the back of his rib cage jamming into the inside of his back-plate.

Vallamere glanced down at the blade protruding from under his chest-piece, momentarily stunned. Shock was quickly replaced with blind rage as he was gripped by a retaliatory vengeance. His blades lashed out in reckless fury, carving a path of carnage through the mercenaries. The air was filled with spraying blood, chunks of flesh and chipped bone.

* * *

Vallamere was standing in the middle of the camp, in a pool of blood and surrounded by bodies. He had lost one of his blades in his rampage, resorting to unarmed combat with that hand. His burning gauntlet had crunched bone and seared flesh with each contact. Looking down he noticed he was still clutching the jaw of some hapless victim.

Kacela arrived beside him, cleaning her axes and trailed by her wolf. His fur was slick with blood, and chunks of flesh had caught in his teeth. They too had faced their share of carnage.

Vallamere looked up, following Kacela's gaze. General Kel stood outside his tent, staring at Vallamere. Although looking pale, he did not seem unduly disturbed by the slaughter around him. His foot was resting on the skull.

Vallamere stepped over the body at his feet, sheathing his sword as he did so. He removed his great-sword from his back and continued his slow, measured approach. Kel sprung into action, charging forward and bringing his own great-sword around in a large sweeping blow. Vallamere met the attack, leaping forward to get inside the reach of the blade. Holding his sword in his left hand, he pummelled his right fist into Kel's abdomen, sending him staggering back. Vallamere pushed his advantage and brought a steel-encased foot crashing down on an unarmoured knee-cap. His crippled victim struggled and failed to raise a defence as a mortal blow severed the arm at the shoulder.

Vallamere stepped back and looked into the eyes of his brother's killer. Without hesitation, he raised his sword and finished the execution, detaching the general's head from his body in a shower of blood.

Vallamere stopped for a moment and stared, as the body collapsed face down at his feet. Then he took a step forward and drove his sword through the general's back and into the ground. Blood slowly drained down the blade as Vallamere turned and walked away.
